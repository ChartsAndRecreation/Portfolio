I'm a business analyst for Construction Forms; an industry leader in the engineering and manufacture of concrete pumping equipment and abrasion resistant pipe. I have over a decade of experience in accounting with an emphasis on accounts receivable and sales tax.

My journey in data science started a few years ago in an effort to avoid the eternal shame of finishing last place in my fantasy football league. While I enjoyed a modest improvement the following year, moving from 9th place to 5th, I found myself wondering how I could apply this to other areas. My passion has continued to grow as I read about how others are creating tools to answer questions and solve problems. It's been personally and professionally rewarding to apply this knowledge and I'm excited to see what's next.
