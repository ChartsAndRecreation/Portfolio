I'm a business analyst for Construction Forms; an industry leader in the engineering and manufacture of concrete pumping equipment and abrasion resistant pipe. I have over a decade of experience in accounting with an emphasis on accounts receivable and sales tax.

My journey in data science started a few years ago in an effort to avoid the eternal shame of finishing last place in my fantasy football league. While I enjoyed a modest improvement the following year, moving from 9th place to 5th, I found myself wondering how I could apply this to other areas. I've been incrementally learning Python, R, and SQL from the amazing online data science community. I'm currently enrolled in the Master of Science in Data Science program at the University of Wisconsin and plan to graduate in the spring of 2024.
