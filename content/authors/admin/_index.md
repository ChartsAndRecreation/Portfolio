I'm a business analyst for Construction Forms; an industry leader in the engineering and manufacture of concrete pumping equipment and other abrasion resistant pipe. I have over a decade of experience in accounting with an emphasis on accounts receivable and sales tax.

Over the past few years, I have discovered my passion for data and I'm currently enrolled in the [University of Wisconsin Master of Science in Data Science](https://datasciencedegree.wisconsin.edu/) program. My journey in data science started in an effort to avoid the eternal shame of finishing last place in my fantasy football league. While I enjoyed a modest improvement the following year, moving from 9th place to 5th place, I found myself wondering how I could apply these tools to other aspects of my professional and personal life. Since then I've written countless SQL queries, dashboards, and markdown documents.
